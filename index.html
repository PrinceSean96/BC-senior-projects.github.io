		<h2>What are <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages?</a></h2>

        
                <p>You get one site per GitHub account. 
			To get started, create a new repository named username.github.io, 
			where username is your Github username.</p>
		
		<p>You don't need to use HTML and CSS, but you will get a lot more control by doing so. </p>

                <h2>What is CSC 493?</h2>
		<p> Students apply modern software engineering approaches to the development of an original, well-documented, 
		software product. The product deliverables will include a product proposal, a specifications and requirements document, 
		an architecture and design document, a test plan document, project status reports, 
			and the code base implementation with quality documentation. Students will demonstrate their
			understanding by presenting and demonstrating the structure and applied elements of their project. 
			Students will need to apply technical, organizational, and communication skills to this project. 
			Successful completion of this course will meet Berea's Computer and Information Science Major 
			capstone requirement.</p>
